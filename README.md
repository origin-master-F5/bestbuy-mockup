An application that uses microservices to feature the design and functional elements of Bestbuy's online retail store.

## Project Description

The project takes 3 microservices each developed by a team member and delivers a single application with navigation, product display, and customer reviews capability.

A microservice architectural approach is taken to organize and maintain loosely coupled and independently deployable components for scalability and other benefits.
